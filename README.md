## üìå Introduction

This is an extension for web browsers that allows for searching for free contents in one place. Simply click on the desired option and type in a search term. 

The user can click or simply hit `ENTER` to perform the search and the corresponding images will be presented.

Also, if you prefer to search for videos, just click the `SWITCH` button and it will switch to searching for free videos.

It is important to note that all sites are in your English version, so it is recommended to make searches in English as well. 

The tools used were:
Javascript for all the code's functionality, CSS for styling, and HTML for the structure and organization of the extension's elements.

In addition to them, it has a .json file for the necessary specifications for the extension to work perfectly.

## üë®‚Äçüíª About the interface

This code is a browser extension designed for finding free contents. It features an HTML form including checkboxes for selecting different image or videos search websites such as Unsplash, Pexels, Pixabay, and more, as well as a search bar.

The added JavaScript manages the selection of options and the search, opening the corresponding pages of the selected websites with the corresponding search. It also includes verification to ensure that the user has selected an option and entered a search term before performing the search.

It will also promote the function of switching between image and video contents.

In other browsers the procedure is similar.

### ‚ù§Ô∏è I hope you like it!

This was my final project for the CS50 course offered by Harvard, it was really challenging and quite rewarding for me to create it!

I decided to go back to work on this project, adding, in version 2.0, the possibility of searching for free video content, so it was quite gratifying to see that the extension is more useful for users.

But I won't stop here, I intend to keep improving this extension until I'm completely satisfied, so if there are any further changes, they will be seen as "release notes".
