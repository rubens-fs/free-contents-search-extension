## üìå Introduction

This is an extension for web browsers that allows for searching for free images in one place. Simply click on the desired option and type in a search term. 

The user can click or simply hit `ENTER` to perform the search and the corresponding images will be presented. 

It is important to note that all sites are in your English version, so it is recommended to make searches in English as well. 

The tools used were:
Javascript for all the code's functionality, CSS for styling, and HTML for the structure and organization of the extension's elements.

In addition to them, it has a .json file for the necessary specifications for the extension to work perfectly.

## üë®‚Äçüíª About the interface

This code is a browser extension designed for finding free images. It features an HTML form including checkboxes for selecting different image search websites such as Unsplash, Pexels, Pixabay, and more, as well as a search bar.

The added JavaScript manages the selection of options and the search, opening the corresponding pages of the selected websites with the corresponding search. It also includes verification to ensure that the user has selected an option and entered a search term before performing the search.
